# PyData2021 tutorial: "Machine learning with time series using sktime"

## Short description
This tutorial is about sktime - a unified framework for machine learning with time series (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime). 

sktime provides functionality for multiple learning problems, including time series classification and forecasting. In this tutorial, you will learn about how you can identify these problems and how they are related. 

To solve these problems, sktime features various time series algorithms and modular tools for pipelining, ensembling and tuning. You will learn how to use, combine, tune and evaluate different algorithms on real-world data sets. In addition, sktime is compatible with many existing libraries, including scikit-learn, statsmodels and fbprophet. 


## Long description
Time series are ubiquitous in real-world applications, but often add considerable complications to data science workflows. Many machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) focus on non-temporal or cross-sectional data. And even though there are many time series libraries, they often incompatible with each other. 

In this tutorial, we will present sktime - a unified framework for machine learning with time series (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime).

sktime covers multiple time series learning problems, including time series classification and forecasting. In the tutorial, you will learn about how you can identify these problems, what their key differences are and how they are related. 

To solve these problems, sktime provides various time series algorithms and modular tools for pipelining, ensembling and tuning and reduction. Reduction allows you to apply an algorithm for one task to solve another (e.g. a scikit-learn regressor to solve a forecasting problem). In addition, sktime is compatible with many existing libraries, including scikit-learn, statsmodels and fbprophet. 

You will learn how to use, combine, tune and evaluate different algorithms on real-world data sets. We'll work through all of this step by step using Jupyter Notebooks. Finally, you will find out about how to get involved in sktime's community.
