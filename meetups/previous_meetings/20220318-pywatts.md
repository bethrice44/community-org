## :clipboard: Agenda

Aim: tech discussion on base class integration before moving forward

as decided Mar 7:
delineate target state for "framework" functionality and use by ecosystem packages


**Proposed:**

1. review action - base class comparison, requirements
2. Q & A and mutual presentations where clarification needed

**Milestone 1: both sktime/pywatts understand the other design**

3. identifying key design decision points (no decisions yet)
4. concretizing consequence in implementation

**Milestone 2: options laid out**

5. decision making - options
6. tickets & actions

**Milestone 3: complete plan**


## Actions from last meeting

-> pywatts & sktime collect requirements
-> look into base classes
    * sktime important classes: `BaseObject`, `BaseEstimator`, `BaseTransformer`, `BaseForecaster`, `ForecastingHorizon`
    * pywatts important classes: `Base`, plus an example. Note, we use a Sampler Module for determining the forecast horizon.




## :pencil: Notes


### Notes from Mar 7 on base interface comparison


pywatts:
* transformer interface has `fit`, `transform`, `inverse_transform` abstracts
* has `get_params`, `set_params`, fully `sklearn` interface compatible
* input/output is xarray
* abstracts are direct, boilerplate needs to be replicated
* `__call__` dunder allows concantenation with network components
* attribute etc `has_inverse_transform`

sktime:
* transformer interface has `fit`, `transform`, `inverse_transform` abstracts
* has `get_params`, `set_params`, fully `sklearn` interface compatible
* input can be flexible (3 series types, 4 panel types) but does not support array
* has two levels `fit`, `_fit`, template pattern, boilerplate in `fit`, implementation in `_fit` etc
* tag system and registry, coming from `BaseObject`


FK: `sktime` follows deprecation management practice: major interface changes require deprecation over two minor version cycles at least


-> very similar, but discrepant enough that needs major alignment on technical level
-> pywatts has graph/network pipeline design, sktime currently does not have (except "network pipeline" prototype which seems more clunky to FK)


### Collaboration space

Questions sktime->pywatts

* can you present/explain pipeline design (in your own words)
    * 3 levels - module, step, pipeline
    * "modules" in pywatts mean "estimator"s as in sklearn
    * pywatts estimators can be transformers or "estimators" (inheriting from BaseTransformer and BaseEstimator)
    * metrics are also "module" for pywatts
* is there an element of "estimator type" interface, e.g., like sktime `BaseForecaster`? If yes, where?


Questions pywatts->sktime

* can you explain the design decision behind the different BaseEstimators


FK observations:
    * transformers can have empty fit or not - pywatts transformers never have a fit? sktime has two cases, empty fit, or no empty fit
