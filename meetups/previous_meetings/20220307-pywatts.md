## Roles
* notetaker - 
* moderator - 

## :clipboard: Agenda

1. framing, goals
2. mutual presentation of base class interfaces, discussion
3. next steps


## :pencil: Minutes

1.

* agreed high-level on mlr structure, mlr/mlr-pipelines
* Martin: condition for that would be some degree of interface compatibility
* letÂ´s then exchange views of key interface elements and requirements




2.

pywatts:
* transformer interface has `fit`, `transform`, `inverse_transform` abstracts
* has `get_params`, `set_params`, fully `sklearn` interface compatible
* input/output is xarray
* abstracts are direct, boilerplate needs to be replicated
* `__call__` dunder allows concantenation with network components
* attribute etc `has_inverse_transform`

sktime:
* transformer interface has `fit`, `transform`, `inverse_transform` abstracts
* has `get_params`, `set_params`, fully `sklearn` interface compatible
* input can be flexible (3 series types, 4 panel types) but does not support array
* has two levels `fit`, `_fit`, template pattern, boilerplate in `fit`, implementation in `_fit` etc
* tag system and registry, coming from `BaseObject`


FK: `sktime` follows deprecation management practice: major interface changes require deprecation over two minor version cycles at least


-> very similar, but discrepant enough that needs major alignment on technical level
-> pywatts has graph/network pipeline design, sktime currently does not have (except "network pipeline" prototype which seems more clunky to FK)


3. MW: status of sktime & pywatts going forward?

* "mlr approach" favoured by pywatts is "core framework" plus ecosystem packages, see 
https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Extension-Packages
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlr-org/mlr3/main/man/figures/mlr3verse.svg?sanitize=true

* agreed by all that this is a good target state

* branding question separate from tech discussion - multiple options. Agreed: work out the tech on base classes first. Continue working for a few months, then review.

4. next steps?

* need to have tech discussion on base class integration before moving forward
-> pywatts & sktime collect requirements
-> look into base classes
    * sktime important classes: `BaseObject`, `BaseEstimator`, `BaseTransformer`, `BaseForecaster`, `ForecastingHorizon`
    * pywatts important classes: `Base`, plus an example. Note, we use a Sampler Module for determining the forecast horizon.
    
-> arrange 1-3 meetings for discussion (aim: delineate target state for "framework" functionality and use by ecosystem packages), with homework & possibly coding in-between. Action to set up meeting is with ?
