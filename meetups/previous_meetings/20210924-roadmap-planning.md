# Roadmap

Current roadmap: https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/roadmap.html

Contributors: @RNKuhns, @mloning

> Key questions to keep in mind:
> * Who is the target audience for the roadmap? Funders, developers, maintainers of other packages, end users 
> * What are the overarching goals?


## Mission Statement
> Review mission statement 
 
sktime enables understandable and composable machine learning with time series. It provides scikit-learn compatible algorithms and model composition tools, supported by a clear taxonomy of learning tasks, with instructive documentation and a friendly community.

## Scope of sktime
> Review scope
* API for machine learning with time series, for the purpose of specifying, fitting, applying and validating machine learning models
* unified framework for multiple learning tasks
* in-memory computation
* medium-sized data
* modular, principled object-oriented API

## Points of Emphasis
> Set 3 - 4 overall goals + measurables
> 
> for example:
> * documentation: number of classes with missing docstrings
> * software engineering: code coverage
> * classification module: implemented algorithms, add specific cutting-edge algorithms 

## Core Areas
> Describe detailed roadmap split by core areas and for short/mid/long term 
>
> Add link to STEPs
>
> Timelines:
> * short term: next 6 month, next 3 releases
> * medium term: next 1 year
> * long term: next 5 years

| Core Area | Coordinator |
|---|---|
| Documentation | | 
| Software engineering & dev ops | |
| Classification | |
| Regression 
| Forecasting
| Clustering
| Data container
| Performance metrics, benchmarking and statistical tests


### Documentation
> Descriptions of work items for core areas

#### Short Term
> * This is a tactical set of tasks we can implement to help us move toward our medium- and long- term goals. 
> * Focus is on next 6 months (3 releases)

#### Medium Term
> * This is akin to an organization’s annual operating plan
> * What are our priorities for new modules, functionality within modules, etc)? 
> * Do we intend to have completed a first draft of user guide content in a year?

#### Long Term
> * What are our concrete goals in terms of the functionality we want to have for each learning task eventually? 
> * What type of documentation do we want to have as part of the project eventually?
> * Do we have long-run expectations for unit testing, the project’s module layout or other important technical areas (that are not learning tasks but are nonetheless important)?


## Progress Report
> Synopsis overall (1-2 sentences)

### Documentation
> Bullet-point summary of progress, updated throughout development
> 
> For example:
> - Created new website
> - Cleaned 20 of 80 class docstrings


## Milestones & Issues
> milestones for releases 
> link to milestones for next releases
