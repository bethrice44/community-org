# sktime classifier dev meeting 13/12/21
###### tags: `sktime`

Here: Tony, Matthew, Jason, Patrick, Chris 

## Suggested actions/decisions:

1. tags/interfaces: prefer to use tags currently. 
2. distances: jay to implement MSM, dtw to have window proportion and window steps option (Chris)
3. knn: move the window CV external to classifiers, sort out fit/_fit with multiple inheritance (Tony)
4. early classifiers: add a tag so that predict can allow early classification. When set, predict will allow series shorter than the input (Matthew)



## Overview of changes since last meeting:
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1599
Speeds up some tests (matthew)

Numba distance module
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1574

Integrate multirocket 
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1567


## Ongoing work:
#### 1. New pipeline classifiers for workshop paper.
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1721
* regenerating tests, where to put commented out code ?commented out code regenerates test results. We want to keep this code somewhere, but dont want large chunks of commented out code in main. Centralise it all and put it in contrib?

#### 2. BaseClass changes: what to put in the base class?
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1594
* PR now passes. 
* Franz is redesigning conversions to use datatypes. 
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1749
We could move other attributes into Base. n_jobs? 

#### 3. Redesign in numba

###### 3.1. distances
Issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1714
Branch: Jay
* Needs MSM
* Should window parameters go from 0..1 or 0..series length
* Can we get parity between tsml and sktime?

###### 3.2 KNN
Issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1713
Branch: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/numba_based_knn

* Needs to use fit/_fit model, how does that work with sklearn? Can we restructure to use sklearn knn fully? 
* Can we tune distance parameters outside of KNN?   

###### 3.3 Elastic Ensemble
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1716

###### 3.4 Proximity Forest
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1715     
 
#### 4. Data loading
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1594
adding loading that returns numpy for equal length problems. Will work on factoring out current loader that always returns a dataframe. Do we insist on tags in .ts files or just default if not present? (e.g. equal_length)

#### 5. Non compliant classifiers
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1609
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1608
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1607
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1606

I intend just wrapping them but any input welcome. 

#### 6. tags vs interfaces?
ISSUE11 Contractable interface
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/159
ISSUE12 TrainEstimate interface
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/727
ISSUE13 classifier family tags
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1390

#### 7. Early classifier design
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1630

#### 8. basic classifier results 
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1129
ISSUE5 https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1123
Oliver Matthews to take this on as part of his third year project.
