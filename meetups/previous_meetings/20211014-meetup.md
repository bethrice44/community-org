* pydata presentation
    * any outstanding org items?
    * fallback/deputization

LT:
* giving presentation about forecasting in Nov 6 in public

MW:
* multivariate compositors PR

LT:
* hierarchical/global forecasting - summary of design discussions
* CI/CD help? 

FK:
* testing refactor merged - next steps discussion
* transformer refactor PR! it's been waiting for so long...



### Notes

* pydata tutorial
    * make release before pydata `v0.8.1`
    * dialogue/multiple presenters? FK: happy to contribute
    * ML: content, what to focus on?
        * FK: extension template, explain extension use case?
        * ML: maybe motivate API design then extension
        * FK: tags and lookup? ML: better estimator overview: agreed: `all_estimators` with tag sub-selection
        * pipeline on target and exogenous data
        * multivariate forecasting (univariate applier, naive forecaster, VAR)
    * FK: need tutorials updated by then! TSC is still "old" (no pipelines etc), forecasting does not have multivariate, tag lookup, estimator overview
    * action ML: first draft, pull in others
* pydata lightning talk
    * Svea/Guzal lightning talk by Oct 18, need to do dry runs
        * SM: schedule calendar event for dry run
* data science festival
    * Leonidas presentation on hierarchical forecasting, using sktime

LT:
* giving presentation about forecasting in Nov 6 in public
    * https://online.datasciencefestival.com/
    * LT: send details to sktime cc for advertisement
    * can reuse material from pydata

MW:
* multivariate compositors PR
    * question about decorators from sklearn - keep or remove, what to do?
    * ML: decorator deprecated, renamed in 1.0; if used need to rename to post-1.0; may need to stay
    * MW will update decorator


LT:
* hierarchical/global forecasting - summary of design discussions
    * components implemented for uni/one-sample case first - calendar features and sliding window
    * aligned on corner points for base class design - long-term decision point: upgrade BaseForecaster or keep separate
    * for now, experimenting in new base class for hierarchical forecasting
    * core data type: multi-indexed series (df or pd/series)
    * "static covariates" as Z?
    * should cover global plus hierarchical
    * ML: using scikit-hts, can contribute to sktime perhaps
* CI/CD help? 
    * want to learn about CI/CD
    * SM: also interested in this!
    * ML: developer workshop? Perhaps early Nov. Happy to do a random screenshare
    * LT: action to take on the org for this. Will be mid-November.
    * ML: could do it on Nov 12 when collab session takes place (1pm UTC)

FK:
* testing refactor merged - next steps discussion
    * ML: test portability? from pytest discussion, can define test as base class, concrete tests inherit from class
    * FK: very elegant!
    * first refactor tests further, then move to classes for portability
* transformer refactor PR! it's been waiting for so long...
    * no one wants to look at this
