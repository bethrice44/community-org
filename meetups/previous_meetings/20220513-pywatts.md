## roadmap planning

### sktime timelines & context

Stand-ups & workstreams to resume May 20 and w/c 27

Google summer of code and summer interns joining end of May 20
ca 5-8 interns

onboarding week w/ May 23
    * might be nice to give short presentation, and/ integrated workstream

plan meeting (stand-up) schedule for over the summer

four workstreams:

* pipelines
* annotation
* benchmarking
* deep learning

(see https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/internships/projects_2022.md)

time until then admin heavy


### pywatts timelines

Benedikt - availability after end of June, but can be there for onboarding (prefers Wednesday)
Stephan - vacation around CH, but there in June


### short-term timeline:

pywatts join onboarding week on day, presentation
skip w/c May 16

aim for "pipeline" workstream to be set up with interested interns

action sktime: proposed slots in onboarding week (preferably Wed or earlier due to south german holiday period)

onboarding week presentation:
    * motivation
    * joint goals with sktime
    * invitation to interns (why interesting)
    * actions
onboarding week - roadmap planning session
    * last yearÂ´s onboarding week schedule
        https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/events/sktime-onboarding-days.md
        
action pywatts: proposed slides/abstract, content


### mid-term:

summer - aim for weekly stand-up tracking tickets

need to revisit with interns (not necessarily Fr, depends on time zone)

but tentative commitment to work in a dedicated workstream

sync after onboarding week? around May 25
(probably will meet on Wed)

action all: after onboarding week schedule communincated, fix meeting for debrief & mid-term plan



### thoughts on tickets/milestones


phase 1 - design, requirements

* user journey designs, possibly for alternatives
* async: home in on a consolidated design
    * classes, architecture
    * how this is split over packages
* main milestone: STEP document
    * here: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals
    * design questions answered, e.g., `__call__`, data type handling
    * resolves open design questions, or lists options
    * if list option, decision must be made (or are blocked)

* big conditionality: status of `__call__` design question
    * need to clarify where call dunder will live
    * Martin was against it in sktime, but not fully decided
    * clarify sktime design position - dev meeting?
    * if stays out of sktime (e.g., no compromise), what happens then?

1 month? (at current speed)
aim for June

some conditionality of May 25 (plusminus days) meeting on the above

priorities?

* resolving call question, major design questions, design requirements
* user journey written out, so presentable (can avoid detail design questions for sake of presentation to interns)

immediate actions:

* action FK: push resolution of `__call__` question at sktime
* re STEP
    * start with user journeys and an issue on sktime
    * FK to (finally) put hackmd content in sktime issue tracker
    * async discussion on there
    * aim to move to STEP PR w/c May 16
    * Benedikt to coordinate PR creation until May 25 meeting, then handover
    * here: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals

* action FK: set up project board



phase 2 - implementation

conditional on design, req

* sklearn base class integration
    * light layer, separate from pywatts layer?
    * FK can help with this
* pywatts refactor for interface compatibility?
    * deprecation needed?
    * refactor policy?

2 months? (at current speed plus intern)
