## Mission Statement
> Review mission statement below
> Move to About section, print on roadmap page
 
sktime provides an easy-to-use, flexible and modular open-source framework for a wide range of time series machine learning tasks. It offers scikit-learn compatible interfaces and model composition tools, with the goal to make the ecosystem more usable and interoperable as a whole. We build and sustain an open, diverse and self-governing community, welcoming new contributors from academia and industry through instructive documentation, mentoring and workshops.


### Themes
- framework
- ecosystem
- community


### Measuring how we achieve our mission
> How do we judge if we're successful in achieving our mission?

- Quantity of usage: Can't achieve mission if we don't have people using sktime and participating in the community
    - Number of contributors, number of downloads, dependent projects, number of stars, how many people participate in developer meetings, etc
    - how much of the key time series analysis ecosystem is usable within a consistent interface
        - Would need to define "key" parts of ecosystem amongst our list of related software
- Quality of experience: Is there a good way to collect feedback from end-users?
    - user testing: surveys/questionaires
    - "expert" feedback: survey/questionaires/interview
        - Does sktime do what it should in terms of scientific methodology and software engineering?
    - number of bug reports (at least for consolidated module)
    - response time to bug reports
    - response time to feature requests

#### Notes
- FK thoughts:
    * number of algorithms native in sktime?
    * change in issues, PR over time? should be on average zero or negative (!)
    * time to first proper PR review! Very important!
        * for new contributors?
        * and developers
    * time to categorize new issues
    * user testing results - need to do this regularly!
        * perhaps also scale this up by online user testing, self-administered
    * Percentage of Issues/PRs with useful response (PR review; issue: categorization and pulling in relevent devs)

### Action Items
- Think about your favorite metrics in each category (and why)
    - Goal is to discuss specific metrics next time
https://sktime-group.slack.com/archives/G01MYS9EFUL/p1634315490343000
- move to report writing section

### Community building, outreach and marketing
> sktime is a community of practice that brings value to both its members and users. Provide regular collaborative/upskilling sessions; create informative content and share it on social media.

#### Short term
- make 2 posts on hashnode and corresponding threads to Twitter + LinkedIn posts (according to format)
- create a todo board on github projects 
- inventory of existing material, posts etc
- reuse existing code snippets, break down tutorials

#### Middle term
- collect good first issues 
- present sktime on a conference similar to pyData (tutorials)
- create a FAQ on the website (especially Windows OS installation, fbprophet issues)
- go through the instructions for windows os, and fix them/update
- record onboarding day one
- record a video on developer setup
- create a collaborative material with other communities/bloggers
- find people who are interested in forecasting but currently don't look at it from data science perspective 
- interactive tutorials (sth like dev days)

#### Long term goals

- created extensive library of learning materials (articles, videos on how to use sktime, on core concepts and best practices of working with time series data)
- robust documentation website (inspiration - sklearn)
- content creation (biweekly articles/posts/videos on social media)
- annual sktime conference with workshops, tutorials (extended sktime dev-days)

### Benchmarking, metrics and statistical tests

#### Short-term

- Separate (and then complete) PR on forecasting loss functions sample-by-sample into:
    - minor refactor of classes (try to use tags to reduce base classes and mixins)
    - Add ability to calculate sample based losses
- Add forecasting performance metric user guide
- Add forecasting performance metrics for measuring "sucess" (e.g. R-Squared, Covariance/Correlation between prediction and actual)
- Add directional accuracy metric
    - Need to re-evaluate interface we proposed way back when
- Complete initial BaseStatisticalTest and unit tests
- Add several concrete implementations of diagnostic and post-hoc statistical tests
    - Diagnostic
        - Seasonality
        - Stationarity
        - Ljung-Box
    - Post-hoc
        - Diebold-Mariano
        - Efficiency
        - Encompassing
        - Directional
            - Runs test
            - Pesaran-Timmerman
        

#### Medium-term

- Add sktime implementations for metrics for learning tasks beyond forecasting:
    - clustering
    - classification
- Add forecasting metrics for evaluating probabilistic/interval/quantile forecasts
- Identify and add datasets that can be used to benchmark different learning tasks and highlight differences between algorithms

#### Long-term

- Finalize framework for benchmarking algorithms (running experiments and then analyzing results) for:
    - annotation (anomaly detection)
    - forecasting
    - classification
    - clustering
    - regression
- Create user-facing benchmark reporting
    - Add new section to documentation

- sktime should include "common" metrics (from literature/books) for:

    - clustering
    - classification
    - regression and forecasting
    - annotation
        - really just an application of other metrics in a certain way

- sktime should include diagnostic tests to aid manual model selection and inspection, as well as post-hoc tests to evaluate properties of model predictions (and compare model predictions against one another).

### Forecasting: general

#### Short term
- pipelining (consolidation, see [STEP](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/01_forecasting_api/forecasting_pipeline.md) Pipelining)
- more multivariate forecasters (e.g. VECM)
- multivariate make_reduction
- compositions based on decompositions (e.g. STL)
- stabilization based on feedback/bugs from industry applications
- More ensemble algorithms implemented in AutoEnsembleForecaster
- efficient ensembling of fitted models

#### Middle term
- integration of forecasting API into mlflow (not only forecasting related?)
- panel forecasting
- HTS
- Forecasting algorithm overview 
    - describing the properties of them and showing on what kind of data they are performing well
    - comparison of algorithms and user guidance

#### Long term goals
- Explainable AI (XAI) sub-module as part of forecasting module. (XAI for forecasting is a research gap currently.)
- More forecasting algorithms implementations directly in sktime instead wrapping from other packages.
- Forecasting interface established as interface standard, so that other FOSS packages have adopted it.
- Complete coverage of traditional forecasting algorithms
- Probabilistic forecasting (confidence intervals)
- Good date/time related functionality (estimators, transformations, plotting, etc)
