### collaboration area


Main design decision points

### architectural, high-level

* relation of sktime, pywatts base APIs - target state
    * option 1: joint base API
    * option 2: separate base API, adaptors
    * option 3: separate base API, no adaptors
    * FK opinion: I think we need option 1. We decided this last time, I think, or else we can't talk about the other points productively.
    * KP opinion: yep, agree with Franz.

sktime: FK, MW agree, preferably option 1 - for decision at CC
pywatts: all agree, preferably option 1

* nature of joint base API (needed as dev basis and for interoperability). Which base class interface to adopt in the end?
    * explanation: base API excludes dunder topic, excluding pipeline logic
    * option 1: sktime
    * option 2: pywatts
    * option 3: develop new or synthesis
    * analysis of alternatives: option 1, sktime, seems most mature, least work needed. pywatts does not have "type specific base classes". sktime has large user base and testing framework dependent on its interface, any change to that would cause major disruption
    * FK opinion: should be option 1, anything else seems like a no-go for sktime and large user base
    * BH opinion: depends *where* we change sth, e.g., whether changes are downwards compatible, additional, or change loci of high dependency
    * KP opinion: agree that changes for a large user base for sktime will be difficult. However, additions that can be ignored downstream but enable functionality for pyWATTS should perhaps be considered.

sktime: FK, MW agree, preferably option 1; as said, dunder/pipeline discussed separately. For decision.
pywatts: all agree, preferably option 1

* package structure
    * option 1: sktime + pywatts
        * implication: 2 packages, separately maintained in a joint ecosystem. As-is state, plus likely some integrative moves.
        * MW thinks there is problematic implication also in "option 1 first then other option": if we go for option 1, would waste time
        * FK: but anything except option 1 at the start seems require more substantial effort. BH: agree, option 1 and then possibly sth else is the agile approach.
    * option 2: one merged package
        * implication: "package merge". FK: this needs to start at a merge design & requirements effort
    * option 3: sktime core + sktime modules + pywatts
        * implication: "ecosystem refactor". FK: also starts at the design board
    * FK opinion: I would prefer option 1 short-term, option 3 long-term, similar to the mlr ecosystem. Option 2 is "bad" imo since it creates a monster package and it moves *away* from modularity. Moving *towards* modularity is a design desideratum.
    * BH opinion: I aggree to Franz.
    * SM comment: How to handle testing in options 1, 2, and 3?
        * FK: tests from sktime can be extended and imported
        * FK: what about pywatts test?
    * KP opinion: I also think that option 3 long-term and option 1 short-term is the best option.
    * MW prefers option 2, right away
        * FK: why is preferable to option 1 then option 2?
        * MW: saving effort in refactor through redesign first
    * MW is also ok with option 1, due to more agile start. Can revisit 2 vs 3 for long-term at the design board.

sktime: FK, MW option 1, for decision

pywatts: all agree, preferably option 1

#### class interface level

* `__call__` interface point of pywatts, what to do about this.
    * option 0a: call dunder has to be implemented in sktime modules, additional to existing pipelines = adding to base interface. The same as 1a or 1b
    * option 0b: replacing ForecastingPipeline in sktime by call dunder & adding to base interface
        * clarification BH: this as meant as replacing FP by pywatts pipeline, but that is a separate decision point, could "coexist"
        * FK: current * dunder does similar thing, called from base class (transformer etc), constructs specialized pipeline class. But current sktime user interface weighs the explicit construction option more heavily in its self-presentation.
        * variant of option 1 where, in addition, ForecastingPipeline gets replaced by the pywatts pipeline
    * KP comment: this point is already discussed above.

    * option 1: sktime adopt pywatts or with minor changes
    * option 1b: integration in sktime base interface, but only if pywatts package/module is loaded or enabled
    * option 2: pywatts as decorator or mixin for sktime
    * option 3: pywatts wraps sktime, adaptor pattern, user has to wrap
    * option 4: sktime provides adaptor, user has to use
    * option 5: stays in pywatts, sktime does nothing
    * FK opinion: I would go with option 1, I think this is well thought out and elegant. Will be familiar to keras users. We need to think how it works together with dunders and other magic methods, but that seems like a solvable problem.
    * MW opinion: concern on `__call__` method, design departure from scikit-learn. Consequence would be major design departure from sktime.
        * FK: yes, it is closer to keras philosophy
        * GB: agree, would like to avoid integrating it into sktime
        * BH: agrees, but thinks synthesis of scikit-learn and keras designs could lead to improvements, both will be familiar to generic data science community members. Departure but not in opposition.
        * GB: seems like design complication, may be design overload. Simplicity of design is a design desideratum, and it will reduce simplicity.
        * SM: can we do this that you only get this only if you load pywatts? I.e., only then, the `__call__` dunder is added, and it is a user choice.
    * MW opinion: `__call__` is a specific design choice, not necessarily needed for network/graphical pipeline. Is against. We may want to go back to the design table and tease apart the decision on network pipeline vs specific implementation of network pipeline.
    * MW: could start with option 5 and drill down on the topic in further design discussions, consequences/implications are not fully clear yet
        * main concern is move away from sklearn philosophy
    * BH, option 6: sktime to adopt pywatts `__call__`, but as a method of specific name, e.g., `pipeline` or `chain` etc
    * MW: are there graphical pipelines for sklearn?

* status of the "module" formalism in pywatts
    * option 1: remove/abandon
    * option 2: massage into BaseObject formalism
    * option 3: separate/parallel existence
    * analysis: "modules" are to large extent estimators, but they do not map 1:1 since it could include statistical analysis or plotting of results, which sktime does not abstract. It may be desirable to have abstractions for such "reporting" workflow steps.
    * FK opinion: I would prefer option 3 short-term, move to option 2 mid-term (largely based on pywatts design). sktime had similar design studies around benchmarking, reporting, e.g., the statistical tests module and reporting functionality which got abandoned. This may be a larger piece of work though.
    * BH opinion: I would prefer option 3 for now but in future we should aim to realise point 2. Option 3 is easy to realise. Option 2 would unify the API. However, for option 2, we need to think which BaseObjects and how they are defined (Task dependent or output dependent)
    * KP opinion: I think option 2 is definitely a good long term target, but option 3 is probably simpler to implement for now. 

* BH: how input for module is handled when passed to estimator, e.g., mapping on forecasting horizon, handling of AR forecasts (as opposed to "reduced" forecasts where you have X, y and predict y from X)
    * option 1: pywatts wraps sktime
    * option 2: redesign of pywatts "module" design
    * FK, option 3: adoption of sktime would allow handling that easily via fh?
    * BH, option 4: allow usage of ForecastingHorizon also in pyWATTS. Extend the step functionality in pyWATTS to enable AR strategies etc. Probably similiar to option 2.
    * BH opinion: I think we have to elaborate more on the different options. Currently, I am not able to decide which option I prefer.

* base class interface: handling and specification of input data formats
    * option 1: only xarray
    * option 2: sktime data formats, sktime native interface
    * FK, option 3: sktime data formats plus xarray, using sktime datatypes module (easily extensible :smiley: )
    * option 4: custom data format for allowing different kind of passed data. E.g., an object identifying if the data is a time series or only a snippet (might be interessting for motif discovery)
        * FK: that's the "adaptor/strategy" pattern, right? Yes
    * option 5: sth else
    * BH opinion: Depending on the option about the BaseObject, option 4 might be useful for checking if the output and input of consecutive BaseObject match. However, I suppose that the easiest way is option 3.

* How to handle inputs from multiple sources a provided to a sktime module (e.g., calendar information and time series values itself)
    * FK comment: this is about "network pipeline" or "graph pipeline" design, right? `__call__` allows to handle this nicely. Sktime does not have this.
    * BH, Option 1: pyWATTS has to concat these data in a way that sktime estimators can handle them. 
    * BH, Option 2: This is not allowed for sktime estimators
    * BH, Option 3: skTime estimators allow it if and when useful.
    * MW: I have an open PR: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1727

* How to save and load pipelines to and from folders?
    * KP comment: having the ability to save and load pipelines (including parameters) is an important aspect for the use of pipelines. Therefore it is definitely a feature that should survive through any changes. We are not sure how easy this is to integrate with sktime.
    * SM option 1: pyWATTS ensures that sktime estimators can be loaded and saved
    * SM option 2: sktime implements save and load functionality
        * FK: yes, could be some default "persistence" interface
    * FK: what´s wrong with pickle? is that a viable option 3?
        * BM: keras models cannot be pickled, may pose issues
