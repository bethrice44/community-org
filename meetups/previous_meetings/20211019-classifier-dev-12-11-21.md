## Active PRs

**PR1**. Numba distance module (Chris to walk through)
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1574
ISSUE1 https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1538

need to sort out the singleton to make timings equivalent to cython

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1594
ISSUE2 https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1537

agreed that Tony will do it his preferred way then franz will sub branch and do it his preferred way. 

**PR3**. Integrate multirocket 
Florian Stinner collaborating with Chang Wei?

## complete

2. Refactor for fit/_fit (Tony/Matthew)
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1146



### Ongoing longer term issues

1. purge cython (Chris/Jay/?)
    distances and NN classifier
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1039
    MrSEQL

2. Contractable interface
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/159

3. TrainEstimatable interface

4. Update notebooks and examples
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/878
5. Refactor/merge distances dists_and_metrs
6. Refactor series_as_features
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/212
Options:
    1. Common base class (current model)
    2. Classifier inherits from Regressor
    3. static methods in either Classifier or Regressor

Solution: have it as a transformer: look in detail. Consider with transformer work. 
7. Sort out benchmarking and results evaluator https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/141  
8. speed up unit tests
Many still test on gunpoint and italy. Move to only unit tests. Original shapelet transform
9. Other stuff
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/906
