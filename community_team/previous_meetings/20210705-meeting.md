### :mega: Discussion

1. Agree on regular time for monthly meetings

2. Problem scope for Community Team :
    - Community outreach/marketing
        -  Finding more members for community-team
        - help to prepare for workshop presentations
        - technical Q&A session (like office hour) for sktime users
        - introducing people to the package (who are the people we want to reach out to?)
        - Categories of people we want to reach out to:
            - industrial companies that might be intereted in using sktime
            - developers that are already (or not yet) using sktime
            - related FOSS projects
            - scientific events/organizations
            - reach out to university programs that teach open source development
    - Sozializing with the community/ within the team
        - Docsprint
        - Upskilling (core devs/more senior people teach less experienced contributors)
        - Presenting new modules/releases
        - Presenting STEPs (sktime enhancement proposals)
        - Fun events not related to code?
        - Communication of roadmap planning and implementation (see Roadmap Planning https://hackmd.io/PVubmeU5T4a8EFEtF8c2yA?view)
3. Set up regular internal technical sessions for core devs (maybe to group this meeting with "office hour" meeting, see outreach)
    - Technical Q&A/feedback session for discussing things like PRs, issues etc.
    - Frequency: tbd
    - Martin does survey in Slack about meeting freequency/date etc.
5. Organize social meet-up?
    - post in slack whether people are interested in social night 
        -  organize online games
    - random Slack channel for memes etc. :)
    - mid-term/longterm aim: meeting physically
    - Using tools like Mentimeter
