1. **Announcement and prep for doc sprint w/c Aug 23**
    - to prepare:
        - an [overview document](https://github.com/sktime/community-council/blob/main/events/doc-sprint.md)  - so that people can add things there 
        - collect issues for participants to work on [Ryan, Taiwo, ...]
        - how we run things?
            - prepare user testing workshop (prepare notebook, schedule, hackmd, issue collection etc)
                - forecasting tutorial [Guzal, Taiwo, Martin]
                    - transformation
                    - tuning [Martin]
                    - ensembling
                    - multivariate (exog)
                - classification tutorial [Svea (happy to help but not comfortable doing it on my own)]
                - clustering [Ryan]
                - dev setup - Franz?
                - note: old worksheets available in sktime/workshop repo
            - General schedule (beyond user testing)
        - eventbrite, comms (twitter etc) - Guzal
        - drafting announcement - Guzal
        - NB: 1st day - start with tutorials for the newcomers (to find missing docs and collect issues)


2. **sktime marketing, kats**
    - writing blog posts (e.g. towardsdatascience.com, linkedin.com)
    - our target audiences:
        - industry
        - academics (scientists)
        - academics (students)
        - DS infrastructure platform vendors
    - topics for blog posts:
        - diffent time series learning tasks with sktime examples (can also go into user guide)
        - Multivariate topics (exog): "TS forecasting with exog data in sktime"
            - on macroeconomic data
        - forecasting model tuning, selection and backtesting
        - "how to use fbprophet with sktime" and benchmark it against other models :star: @aiwalter
            - hyperparameter tuning
            - pipelining
            - data: financial data e.g. macroeconomic data
        - class compositions like pipelining
        - how to boost your forecasting performance by (circa) 30% in 3 steps :star:
            - hyperparameter tuning
            - FK: but let's not make scientifically broken claims (like "30% guaranteed" or similar), we still need to be perceived as a quality solution 
            - backtesting with evaluate function
            - MultiplexForecaster for model selection (autoML)
            - pipelining with transformers
3. **Pydata global application**

previous applications: https://github.com/sktime/community-council/tree/main/conferences

5. Topics for dev call Friday 30.07.21
    - schedule:
        - (10 mins, project board managers) quick report-out
        - (10 mins, module owners) roadmap updates
            - advertise the doc sprint
        - (40 mins, issue/PR creator, everyone) focusing on one issue
    - having place where to collect topics would be good

    * FK topic: tags
    * FK topic: transformer refactor
    * FK: how about always spend 15 min time to go through PR?


    - ask about the biweekly meeting (see https://hackmd.io/UrTcChVZTqywxNJWiFCzBg dicussion point 1)
