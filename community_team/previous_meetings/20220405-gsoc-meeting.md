## :pencil: Minutes

- feedback round planning
    - last year markus did all of this
    - do not want to introduce unfair bias, e.g. people who keep badgering
    - ACTION LA: read through GSOC materials for applicants.
    - common feedback from last year: clarity, having a workplan, technical details, commenting on feasibility or duration of projects, be more precise on how to map onto plan.
    - use gsoc system to upload proposal
    - big question of asking people to ask for feedback.
    - some discussion was had. guzal raises big point that it might literally be impossible for us to review all proposals
    - after further discussion agreed on following:
        - use gsoc's interface to read/upload (draft) proposals
        - they should opt in to receiving feedback, via the sktime form
        - there is deadline of roughly 6 working days before final deadline (3 days for us to give feedback, 3 days for them to take feedback onboard)
        - have clause that if there are too many, we put preference on those who ask earlier
    - ACTION: FK to add question to sktime form, whether they want feedback
    - ACTION: LA to write statement, post it in general and update the gsoc22.md. send statement
    - ACTION: FK. to send email/message to people who have already submitted a form
