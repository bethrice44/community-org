1. **Mentoring**
    - Application start Feb 7th
    - Deadline for applications is Feb 21st
    - Action FK, GB, LA: think about topic propositions
        - Topic proposition: Re-factor the mini-rocket and rocket classifiers (now is one giant piece of code)
    - FK hoping to cover 2 or 3 mentors (maybe with some last minute pulling people in)

2. **New YouTube video**
    -  advertise it over social media channels. twitter, linkedin, etc.
    -  add it to README?
    -  markus has access to sktime linkedin account?


3. **Policies on giving talks to companies**
    - FK. how should we respond to individual who reached out to us to give a talk to their company?
    - FK. e.g. are there conflict of interest issues? risk somebody could use this chance to 'sell' or 'advertise' something other than sktime.
    - LA and GB. could ask person to show their presentation before hand and any possible conflicts of itnerest?
    - formally: disclaimer of role in talk (sktime only); lazy preapproval (all content shared with core dev channel in advance, Cc can intervene but usually wonÂ´t)
    - FK: needs approval by CC; probably should be part of policies
    - ACTION for somebody: write up policy, get it approved formally.

4. **Tutorial at UCL**
    - FK. this is low priority.
    - ACTION FK  contaact anthony
