:mega: Discussion
---
1. **Proposition: collect the to-do somewhere outside these hackmds**
    - sth like Asana/Trello/etc so that they don't get lost
    - use github board + issue tracker

2. **For newcomers to sktime:**
    - Many people message about their desire to contribute to some issue and then they disappear - solve this:
        - organise "setup meeting" so people have everything in place >
        - **collab meeting - advertise that people may join it and have their env set up**
    - go through **the instructions for windows** os, and fix them/update!
    - collect FAQs
    - record a video on developer setup - bring it up the next meeting
    - how do we allocate grants etc - add these questions

3. **The fist PRs of newcomers should be a priority for reviews etc**
    - They should work on PRs that are eventually accepted and merged.
        1. Not controversial issues
        2. Issues that are easy to work on / solve
    - check documentation PRs from august
    - We should give them first issues that require them to code
        - not documentation first issues, unless they are motivated to do it 
    - questions regarding good first issues - bring it up at the roadmap planning @GuzalBulatova
