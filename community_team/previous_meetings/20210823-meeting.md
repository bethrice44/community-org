    - ~ 50 people signed up, actually showed up 4 
        - LOCATION: host next sprints on other platforms: Zoom (preferably), Google Meets
        - engage people upfront: ask people about expectations before the event itself. Fill in a little form with questions
    - FRAMING: Sktime bootcamp (onboarding)!

2. Next steps in outreach
    - FK: we got quite a bump from ycombinator, and that was only from a mention in a thread about another package (darts) - perhaps we should plan a dedicated sktime post?
