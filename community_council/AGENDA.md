    * action FK: open issue on failing appveyor
    * action ML: reminder of release schedules, regular, in google calendar, 5 working days excluding weekends reminder no PR merges. Claimed done in Nov 29 minutes by ML. FK: is this really done? For 0.9.0, the time ahead given was half a working day, something must have gone wrong.
