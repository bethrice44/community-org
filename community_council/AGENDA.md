4. FK - proposed change to review process: for core dev authored PR, if passes tests, 2 weeks without review or activity, and listed at least once in a dev meeting as "needs review", can be merged. Reason: trust core devs what they are doing; unblock crucial maintenance/framework changes that are not very exciting and hence tend to get less reviews; enable initial work on innovative "single person expertise" topics before it grows.
