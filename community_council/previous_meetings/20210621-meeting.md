**Minutes**
1. Introduction
2. Updates from community council (ML)

    academic collaborations (UEA, UCL, Turing, among others)
    initial seed funding from Turing 2019
    small funding from JROST 2020
    financial support from Wellcome for Outreachy intern
    mentorship schemes: MLH, GSoC via INCF, Outreachy, Open Life Sciences, sktime's own mentoring
    interactions with related packages (awkward array, pmdarima, neural prophet, hcrystalball, among others)
    growing attention since 2020:
    sktime is being used in industry/applications
    sktime is being used as research platform (publications, co-development of algorithms)
    growing community (users, contributors, core developers)
    growing software, need to share maintenance burden
    currently entirely volunteer driven (no full-time developers/community managers), need to find more sustainable funding (open collective, industry funding, community donations, commercial activities)

3. Future community meetings/events, outreach

Chris: maybe showcase using `sktime`?

monthly community meetings - broad agreement that this is a good idea
* stand-up/lightning talks on ongoing work
* showcase different modules and how to use them
* present different methods for time series analysis 

AP: create committee for organizing monthly meetings & outreach
* Lovkush
* Ryan
* Svea
* Guzal
* Martin
* ...

outreach:
* YouTube channel?
* Federal Forecaster Consortium (Ryan)
* Georgia Tech Online Analytics and CS degree, forecasting class (Ryan)
* SciPy https://www.scipy2021.scipy.org/sprints (connect with @mloning)
* Applied ML Days - contribution opportunity https://appliedmldays.org (connect with @mloning)
* documentation sprint

academic outreach:
* open-source CS courses at Munich university for example: 
    https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/studium/lehrveranstaltungen/master/index.html (applied deep learning with pytorch and tensorflow)
    https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/osp/WS20/index.html (Practical Course â€“ Contributing to an Open-Source Project)

4. Update the technical roadmap for next year (until mid 2022)

moved to Friday

5. Funding model: donations, grants, commercial activities

* GitHub sponsor buttom 
* academic grants
* commercialisation around sktime

commercial outreach: 
* identify industries that use time series analysis
* present at industry conferences

6. Publication roadmap - submit paper to JMLR, keep track of papers that use sktime

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-v2.0-paper

* Ryan
* Lovkush (maybe. i tend to have strong views in writing style so not sure if i would be more hinderance or more help)
    * FK: we can see, so do I.
    * LA: imagine the discussion we had about whether your comment was unnecessary or not - but for the whole of a paper...
    * FK: sounds like we are going to murder each other

7. Co-development with, or alignment with awkward-array development programme

moved to Friday

8. Any other business

Feedback:
* organise and stick to breaks
* make sure agenda is more easily findable
* good use of document for technical discussion
* give option for new joiners for more guided contributions, make clear that new joiners don't feel overwhelmed
* having focal points for core modules
* update links on documentations
