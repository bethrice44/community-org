## Appendix A - special roles for contributors proposal (from Franz)

by FK for discussion, possibly decision

I have seen situations where it would be useful to give non-core-devs elevated access rights to the repo, or a right to review.
I would propose to discuss these and introduce additional roles.

Situation 1: owner of a contributed algorithm or interface

In this case, our rules say the person should be notified if PR is made to their algorithm, and they should be able to review and possibly approve changes to their algorithm (in compliance with sktime rules and interface specifications). Currently, we maintain a CODEOWNERS file for this.
However, the PR notifications and review permissions only work if the user has write access.
Examples: statsforecast, multirocket, augmenters, hcrystalball

Situation 2: "allied" library core devs

Direct dependencies or reverse dependencies may be very active in reporting and reviewing contributions around the relevant dependency interface points. They tend to make PR or review PR with a quick turnaround, especially around the times where we or they move to a new version. Such contributors do not have the capacity to take on full responsibilities of an sktime core dev (because they are already core dev of an allied package), but they - and sktime - may benefit from them acting as core devs around the direct interface points, e.g., having the power to review and approve PR of core devs, push directly to the sktime repo, or getting notifications via CODEOWNERS.
Examples: pycaret, statsforecast, pywatts, tsfresh

for situation 1, we already have a role - algorithm maintainer. We may have to specify how this translates into access rights to the repo.
For situation 2, we could introduce the role of allied or affiliated core dev.


## Appendix B - KNIME (from Patrick)

from Patrick: Potential Cooperation with KNIME (https://www.knime.com)
    * KNIME is a software to create and productionize data science using one easy and intuitive environment
    * KNIME is currently working on python M/L functionality 
    * We might cooperate with KNIME on integrating sktime their software by adapters
    * Advatanges: increase visibility of sktime - integrate into an easy to use GUI with a large (commercial) customer base, might be part of some hackathon? Other options (thought og pydata initially)?
    * Disadvantages: KNIME is partially commercial, but distribtues its software open source (GNU)
