## Agenda

4. v0.4.3 release and transformer types (@mloning)

## Minutes

1. Review of minutes and actions of Oct 12

Action FK: 2-pager - done, for discussion today

not done, move forward:
* AP: @fkiraly review PR on transform types
* AP: @fkiraly user guide 

2. Soft dependencies
* structural flaw: soft dependencies not properly isolated for imports, entangled in shared `__init__.py` files
* make `numba` a hard dependency
* properly isolate `tsfresh`
* write unit test to test if soft dependencies are properly isolated

3. Signature PR
* our default stance is to minimise dependencies (see GOVERNANCE document)
* custom installation instructions for signatory (beyond standard pip/conda instructions) require downstream custom setup in sktime which makes our installation instruction brittle 
* we propose to set up a sktime-signatures repo in the sktime organisation on GitHub

4. v0.4.3 release
* AP @mloning: make new release before introducing breaking changes with transform type PR and refactoring of utils
